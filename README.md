# GoWeb

A replacement for "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" in Go.

***

### Features

* no huge python installation and packages required
* its binary footprint is 4 times smaller than SimpleHTTPServer
* there are no external dependencies -- everything is from Go's standard libraries
* it's fast enough for my <a href="http://cleesmith.github.io/" target="_blank">blog</a>
  - currently at github.io but with goweb it can be hosted anywhere
* pre-built binary <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/goweb/releases" target="_blank">releases</a> for all OS/architecture's that Go provides

### ToDos

* input params
  * host
  * port
